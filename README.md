# Analytica

##### ***‚ö†Ô∏è Originally developed in Fall 2020***

Analytica is a web app to solve systems of linear equations using:

 * Algebraic methods:
	* Gauss Elimination.
	* Gauss Elimination using pivoting.
	* Gauss Jordan.
	* LU Decomposition
	
 * Numerical methods:
	 * Gauss Seidil
	 * Jacobi Iteration

Not only showing the final solution, but all the steps involved to get that solution.
